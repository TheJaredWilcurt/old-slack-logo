These are the files you can use to restore Slacks older logo, the one that doesn't suck as bad (but still kinda sucks).


# Instructions

1. Close and exit Slack
1. Download this repo
1. Navigate to `C:\Users\your-name\AppData\local\slack`
1. Copy files over into each of the folders

I'm to lazy to write a batch script for this.

I've only had to do this twice, so I guess they don't update it very often or something ðŸ¤·
